                     mainly happens because the consistency of the dough is not soft.<br>
                     So, if you want your rotis to be soft when you bite in them, then <br>
                     knead the dough with warm water.You can also do the finger test <br>
                     after kneading the dough,just poke the dough slightly with one<br>
                     finger,and if it feels soft, then you are good to go!Make sure to<br> 
                     rest the dough for at least 15 minutes before cooking!</p>

                        How To Peel Garlic Quickly

                        We all love adding garlic to our dishes, but let's admit we hate<br>
                         peeling the small buds,and it certainly takes up a lot of time.<br>
                          So to minimize that, you can first peel a lot of garlic together<br>
                           and blend a paste out of it. Then add it in a ziplock and store it<br> 
                           in the freezer. If you want to make your garlic peeling time faster<br>
                           then add the garlic buds in an container and shake them so that the<br> 
                           skin comes out from the pods.
